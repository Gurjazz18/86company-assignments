<h1 align="center" id="title">Media App</h1>
This app is like a digital bulletin board where you can add and view users. Imagine you have a wall where you can stick notes with people's names and email addresses.

Backend (the behind-the-scenes part):

The server is like the manager of this bulletin board. It's built using a tool called Express.
The database (MongoDB) is like a big drawer where the notes are stored.
There are special notes called users. Each user note has a name and email.
Frontend (what you see and interact with):

The app is the screen you look at, and it's created using React.
The list you see is like a collection of notes. Each note has a name and email.
You can add a new note by typing a name and email in the spaces provided. It's like sticking a new note on the board.
How It Works:

When you add a new note (user), the app talks to the server and asks it to store the new note in the database.
When you open the app, it talks to the server to get the list of notes (users) from the database and shows them on the screen.
So, it's like a digital board where you can keep track of people's names and email addresses, and you can add new people whenever you want. The app and the server work together to make this happen!
